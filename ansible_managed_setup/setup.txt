Create a Virtual Machine

Open That machine

Login

sudo -i

Change root password [passwd root]

New Password : XXXXXX

Retype Password : XXXXXX

Password changed sucessfully

Go to vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config

Permitrootlogin --yes

Password Authentication --yes

Logout root user

Logout normal user

Open VM in putty session through IP Address

Login:root

Password : XXXXXXX

Check Hostname [hostname]

Change Hostname [hostnamectl set-hostname <hostname>]

bash

Again check is it changed or not

Now Create key

ssh-keygen

Everything will be default

File path : Enter

Pharase : Enter

Retype : Enter

ssh--copy-id root@<IP Address>

Then asking password we are already set so you can enter that password

Now check system is connected or not

ansible all -m ping

you can check only one server or all servers at a time

{
	IP Address: .....
	'ping:pong"
}




same process in other servers also


Note : Every machine has connected with same network like Bridge Adapter
